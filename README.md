# Lachesis Exporter

Use this exporter to get your metrics into your Prometheus instance!
You will be able to visualize it afterwards with Grafana etc.

## Current State:
Currently only epoch is supported. Other metrics like block height, total transactions etc will follow after the fantom-api-graphql is used for querying data.
