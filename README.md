# Lachesis Exporter

Use this exporter to get your metrics into your Prometheus instance!
You will be able to visualize it afterwards with Grafana etc.

## Current State:
Right now no metric is supported. Epoch is fetched from the node but not yet passed to the /metrics endpoint.
This will change soon and additional metrics are to follow!
